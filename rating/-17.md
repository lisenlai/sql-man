```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT STRING_AGG(trip_no::text, '' ORDER BY trip_no) AS concat
    FROM Trip
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT SUBSTRING(concat FROM start FOR 3)::INTEGER AS num
    FROM CTE
    JOIN (
        SELECT GENERATE_SERIES(1, LENGTH(concat)-LENGTH(concat)%3, 3) AS start
        FROM CTE
    ) CTE3
    ON CTE3.start IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT MIN(num), MAX(num), SUM(num)
```

能通过的sql语句，适用于SQL SERVER
```sql
WITH Concatenated AS (
    SELECT (SELECT CAST(trip_no AS VARCHAR(MAX)) + ''
            FROM Trip
            ORDER BY trip_no
            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE).value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)') AS concat
),
RecursiveNumbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS Number
    UNION ALL
    SELECT Number + 3
    FROM RecursiveNumbers
    CROSS JOIN Concatenated
    WHERE Number + 3 <= LEN(Concatenated.concat) - LEN(Concatenated.concat) % 3
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING(concat, Number, 3) AS INT) AS num
    FROM Concatenated, RecursiveNumbers
)
SELECT MIN(num), MAX(num), SUM(num)
FROM CTE2
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0)
