我把b.date <= leap.Tuesday 改为 b.date < leap.Tuesday就对了，好恶心
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT GENERATE_SERIES(TO_DATE('1600-04-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_DATE('2100-04-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), INTERVAL '4 years') AS leap_april
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT GENERATE_SERIES(leap_april, leap_april + INTERVAL '14 days', '1 day') AS day
    FROM CTE
    WHERE (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM leap_april)::INTEGER % 100 != 0) OR (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM leap_april)::INTEGER % 400 = 0)  
),
leap AS (
    SELECT MIN(day) + interval '1 day' AS Tuesday
    FROM CTE2
    WHERE EXTRACT(DOW FROM day) = 1
    GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day)
)
SELECT name, TO_CHAR(date, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), TO_CHAR(MIN(Tuesday), 'YYYY-MM-DD')
FROM battles b
JOIN leap
ON b.date < leap.Tuesday 
AND b.date + INTERVAL '8 years' >= leap.Tuesday
GROUP BY name, date
```
