```
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cte c2
    WHERE c2.result = 'sunk' AND c2.country = cte.country
)
```
这条语句坑死人

Right answer.
会存在同时country、ship相同，result为NULL和其他结果的值，这是FULL JOIN导致的结果，
所以使用distinct ship，所以第二种可能更好一点
1. 
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT country, os.ship, result
    FROM Classes c
    JOIN (
        SELECT COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class, COALESCE(s.name, o.ship) AS ship, result
        FROM Outcomes o
        FULL JOIN Ships s
        ON o.ship = s.name
    ) AS os
    ON c.class = os.class
)
SELECT country
FROM cte
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ship) = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ship) FROM cte c2
    WHERE c2.result = 'sunk' AND c2.country = cte.country
)
```
2. 
```sql
WITH cte AS (
 SELECT ship, country from outcomes o
 JOIN classes c ON (c.class = o.ship)
 UNION
 SELECT name as ship, country FROM ships s
 JOIN classes c ON (c.class = s.class)
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT outcomes.ship, country, result
    FROM cte
    JOIN outcomes
    ON cte.ship = outcomes.ship
    WHERE result = 'sunk'
)
SELECT country
FROM cte2
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cte
    WHERE cte.country = cte2.country
)
```

Wrong answer.
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT country, c.class, result
    FROM Classes c
    JOIN (
        SELECT COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class, result
        FROM Outcomes o
        LEFT JOIN Ships s
        ON o.ship = s.name
    ) AS os
    ON c.class = os.class
)
SELECT country
FROM cte
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT('any') = (
    SELECT COUNT('any') FROM cte c2
    WHERE c2.result = 'sunk' AND c2.country = cte.country
)
```

// 少三
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT country, c.class, result
    FROM Classes c
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class, result
        FROM Outcomes o
        FULL JOIN Ships s
        ON o.ship = s.name
    ) AS os
    ON c.class = os.class
)
SELECT country
FROM cte
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT('any') = (
    SELECT COUNT('any') FROM cte c2
    WHERE c2.result = 'sunk' AND c2.country = cte.country
)
```

// 多一
```sql 
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT country, c.class, result
    FROM Classes c
    JOIN (
        SELECT COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class, result
        FROM Outcomes o
        LEFT JOIN Ships s
        ON o.ship = s.name
    ) AS os
    ON c.class = os.class
)
SELECT country
FROM cte
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT('any') = (
    SELECT COUNT('any') FROM cte c2
    WHERE c2.result = 'sunk' AND c2.country = cte.country
)
```
