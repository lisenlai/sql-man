Right answer
```sql
SELECT date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY inc_serial, out_serial) AS serial_no, 
inc_point, inc, out_point, out
FROM (
    SELECT COALESCE(i_date, o_date) AS date, INC_CTE.*, OUT_CTE.*
    FROM (
        SELECT i.date AS i_date, i.point AS inc_point, inc, i.code AS inc_code,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY code) AS inc_serial
