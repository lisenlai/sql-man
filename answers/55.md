Right answer
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT COALESCE(s.class, c.class) AS class, s.name, s.launched
    FROM Ships s
    FULL JOIN Classes c ON s.class = c.class
)
SELECT 
    class, 
    COALESCE(
        MIN(CASE WHEN name = class THEN launched END),
        MIN(launched)
    ) AS year
FROM CTE
GROUP BY class;
```

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT COALESCE(s.class, c.class) AS class, s.name, s.launched
    FROM Ships s
    FULL JOIN Classes c ON s.class = c.class
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT class, launched
    FROM CTE
    WHERE CTE.name = CTE.class
)
SELECT class, launched
FROM CTE2
UNION ALL
SELECT class, MIN(launched)
FROM CTE
WHERE class NOT IN (SELECT class FROM CTE2)
GROUP BY class
