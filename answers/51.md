Right Answer
需要考虑classes表的有些class可能没有ship的情况，这时候应该要选择第二大的class
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(s.name, o.ship) AS name, COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class
    FROM SHIPS s
    FULL JOIN Outcomes o ON o.ship = s.name
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT name, c.numGuns, c.displacement
    FROM Classes c
    JOIN CTE ON c.class = CTE.class
)
SELECT CTE2.name
FROM CTE2
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT displacement, MAX(numGuns) as maxGuns
    FROM CTE2
    GROUP BY displacement
) AS groupedClasses ON CTE2.displacement = groupedClasses.displacement 
     AND CTE2.numGuns = groupedClasses.maxGuns;
```

```sql
SELECT name FROM 
(
    SELECT c.class
    FROM Classes c
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT displacement, MAX(numGuns) as maxGuns
        FROM Classes
        GROUP BY displacement
    ) as groupedClasses ON c.displacement = groupedClasses.displacement 
     AND c.numGuns = groupedClasses.maxGuns
) AS CTE
JOIN 
(
    SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(s.name, o.ship) AS name, COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class
    FROM SHIPS s
    FULL JOIN Outcomes o
    ON o.ship = s.name
) AS CTE2
ON CTE.class = CTE2.class
```
