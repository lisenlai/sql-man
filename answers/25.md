不知道是不是数据问题，
```
SELECT MAX(speed)
FROM (
    SELECT speed
    FROM PC
    WHERE ram = (
        SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC
    )
) AS ms
WHERE ram = (SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC)
```
和
```
SELECT MAX(speed)
FROM PC
WHERE ram = (
    SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC
)
```
得到不同的结果，在这个回答里，第一个是对的，我未知区别在哪，做个记录
而且我去除`WHERE ram = (SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC)`得到结果也不同

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT maker
FROM Product
WHERE maker IN (
    SELECT maker 
    FROM Product
    JOIN PC ON Product.model = PC.model
    WHERE PC.speed = (
        SELECT MAX(speed)
        FROM (
            SELECT speed
            FROM PC
            WHERE ram = (
                SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC
            )
        ) AS ms
        WHERE ram = (SELECT MIN(ram) FROM PC)
    )
)
AND type = 'Printer';
```
