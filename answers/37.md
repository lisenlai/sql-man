Right answer.
```sql
SELECT Classes.class
FROM Classes
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(s.name, o.ship), COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class
    FROM Ships s
    FULL JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship
) AS so
ON Classes.class = so.class
GROUP BY Classes.class
HAVING COUNT(1) = 1;
```

```sql
SELECT Classes.class
FROM Classes
JOIN (
    SELECT class 
    FROM Ships
    UNION ALL
    SELECT ship AS class
    FROM Outcomes
) AS so
ON Classes.class = so.class
GROUP BY Classes.class
HAVING COUNT(so.class) = 1;
```
