真的不太懂
Right answer. Good Job! 真正理解了这几张表
```sql
SELECT country, ROUND(AVG(bore * bore * bore * 0.5)::numeric, 2)
FROM Classes
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(s.name, o.ship), COALESCE(s.class, o.ship) AS class
    FROM Ships s
    FULL JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship
) AS so
ON Classes.class = so.class
WHERE bore IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country;
```

```sql
SELECT country, ROUND(AVG(bore * bore * bore * 0.5)::numeric, 2)
FROM Classes
JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.class sc, o.ship os
    FROM Ships s
    FULL JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship
) AS So
ON Classes.class = COALESCE(So.sc, So.os)
WHERE bore IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country;
```

```sql
SELECT country, ROUND(AVG(bore * bore * bore * 0.5)::numeric, 2)
FROM Classes c
JOIN (
    SELECT s.class AS class
    FROM Ships s
    UNION
    SELECT O.ship AS class
    FROM Outcomes o
    WHERE result != 'sunk'
) AS so
ON c.class = so.class
WHERE bore IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country;
