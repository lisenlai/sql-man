```sql
SELECT maker
FROM Product p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Product p2
    WHERE p.maker = p2.maker AND p2.type != 'Printer'
)
UNION
SELECT maker
FROM Product p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Product p2
    WHERE p.maker = p2.maker AND p2.type != 'PC'
)
GROUP BY maker
HAVING COUNT(model) >= 3
```

CHATGPT的简洁写法
```sql
SELECT maker
FROM Product
GROUP BY maker
HAVING 
    -- 只生产打印机
    SUM(CASE WHEN type <> 'Printer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
    -- 或者只生产PC且至少有3种型号
    OR (SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'PC' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 3 
        AND SUM(CASE WHEN type <> 'PC' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0);
```
