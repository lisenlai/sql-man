My right answer!
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.class AS class, COALESCE(o.ship, s.name) As name
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship OR s.class = o.ship
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT c.class, c.name, o.result
    FROM CTE c
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON c.name = o.ship
    WHERE result = 'sunk'
),
CTE3 AS (
    SELECT class
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY class
    HAVING COUNT(name) >= 3
)
SELECT c2.class, COUNT(name) AS sunKen
FROM CTE2 c2
JOIN CTE3 c3
ON c2.class = c3.class
GROUP BY c2.class
```

Right answer
```sql
WITH sunk_ships AS (
  SELECT C.class, S.name, O.result FROM classes as C
  LEFT JOIN ships as S ON (C.class = S.class)
  LEFT JOIN outcomes as O ON (O.ship = S.name)
  WHERE O.result = 'sunk'
  UNION
  SELECT C.class, O.ship, O.result FROM classes as C
  LEFT JOIN outcomes as O ON (O.ship = C.class)
  WHERE O.result = 'sunk'
),
clasess_with_sunk_ships AS (
 SELECT sships.class, COUNT(sships.result) sunk_count FROM sunk_ships sships
 GROUP BY sships.class
),
all_ships AS (
 SELECT C.class, S.name FROM classes as C
 JOIN ships as S ON (C.class = S.class)
 UNION
 SELECT C.class, O.ship FROM classes as C
 JOIN outcomes O ON (O.ship = C.class)
),
classes_with_valid_count AS (
 SELECT aships.class, COUNT(aships.name) count FROM all_ships as aships
 GROUP BY aships.class
 HAVING COUNT(aships.name) >= 3
)
SELECT cwsships.class, cwsships.sunk_count FROM clasess_with_sunk_ships cwsships
JOIN classes_with_valid_count cwvcount ON (cwvcount.class = cwsships.class)
```

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT s.class AS class, s.name As name, o.result As result
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship
    UNION
    SELECT s.class AS class, o.ship AS name, o.result As result
    FROM Ships s
    JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.class = o.ship
)
SELECT class, COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) AS sunKen
FROM CTE
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(name) >= 3 AND COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) >=1;
```
 
```sql
WITH CTE2 AS (
    SELECT class
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship OR (s.name != o.ship AND s.class = o.ship)
    GROUP BY class
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
),
CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.class AS class, s.name As name, o.result As result
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship
    WHERE class IN (SELECT class FROM CTE2)
)
SELECT class, COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) AS sunKen
FROM CTE
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) >=1;
```

还真的是最后的语句出了问题
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.class AS class, COALESCE(o.ship, s.name) As name
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship OR s.class = o.ship
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT c.class, c.name, o.result
    FROM CTE c
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON c.name = o.ship
),
SELECT class, COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) AS sunKen
FROM CTE2
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(name) >= 3 AND COUNT(CASE WHEN result='sunk' THEN 1 END) >=1;
```

```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT s.class AS class, COALESCE(o.ship, s.name) As name
    FROM Ships s
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON s.name = o.ship OR s.class = o.ship
),
CTE2 AS (
    SELECT c.class, c.name, o.result
    FROM CTE c
    LEFT JOIN Outcomes o
    ON c.name = o.ship
    WHERE result = 'sunk'
),
CTE3 AS (
    SELECT class
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY class
    HAVING COUNT(name) >= 3
)
SELECT c2.class, COUNT(name) AS sunKen
FROM CTE2 c2
JOIN CTE3 c3
ON c2.class = c3.class
GROUP BY c2.class
```
